# NodeCMS
This is a CMS (basic of course) built in NodeJS and prepared for docker. The docker commands are in the root directory for anyone wanting to build via docker.

For local development, simply change the process.env.<mongo-variable-name> in app.js for the variable name found in the config directory.
